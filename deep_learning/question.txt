Build and Train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Problem Statement
You are tasked with building and training a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to solve a real-world classification problem. The objective is to preprocess the dataset, design an ANN model, train it, evaluate its performance, and report your findings.

Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (Binary classification) – Link
Tasks
Data Preprocessing
Load and explore the dataset.
Handle missing values (if any).
Normalize/standardize features.
Split into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Design
Implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
Experiment with at least 3 hidden layers (Tune neurons, activation functions).
Use ReLU for hidden layers and Softmax/Sigmoid for output (depending on task).
Model Training
Train your model for at least 50 epochs with a suitable optimizer (SGD/Adam).
Implement Early Stopping or Learning Rate Scheduler.
Track loss and accuracy curves.
Model Evaluation
Report Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score on the test set.
Show the confusion matrix.
Compare performance between training and test sets.
Experimentation
Try different optimizers or architectures.
Observe and explain how hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of layers/neurons) affect performance.
Report
Submit a short report (2–3 pages) including:
Dataset overview
ANN architecture details
Training process & plots (loss/accuracy curves)
Final results (metrics, confusion matrix)
