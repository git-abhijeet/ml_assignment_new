## üîó Data Relationships

-   **Primary Key Connections**:
    -   `NOC` appears in Athletes.xlsx, Coaches.xlsx, Medals.xlsx, Teams.xlsx
    -   `Discipline` appears in Athletes.xlsx, Coaches.xlsx, EntriesGender.xlsx, Teams.xlsx
-   **Merging Strategy**:
    -   Athletes.xlsx + Medals.xlsx (on NOC) for athlete-medal analysis
    -   Athletes.xlsx + EntriesGender.xlsx (on Discipline) for gender participation
    -   Teams.xlsx + Medals.xlsx (on NOC) for team performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Limitations

-   No physical attributes (height, weight, age) for athletes
-   No performance metrics or timing data
-   Some columns have missing values (e.g., Event in Coaches.xlsx)

## üìã Analysis Assignment Requirements

-   Generate 10 valuable insights using Pandas
-   Include data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
-   Focus on patterns in medal distribution, gender participation, sports analysis
-   Submit as Jupyter Notebook with code, outputs, and explanations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup

-   **Dependencies**: pandas, openpyxl, matplotlib, seaborn
-   **File Format**: Excel (.xlsx) files
-   **Python Version**: Compatible with Python 3.x

## üìà Potential Insights

Based on available data, possible analysis areas:

1. Medal distribution by country
